### [L-2] Depreciated Function `setupRole` used in `Neuron::addMinter` can lead to security risk

**Description:**

The addMinter function in `Neuron.sol` uses the `_setupRole` function, which is marked as deprecated in OpenZeppelin's AccessControl contract. The use of deprecated functions can lead to potential issues, including security vulnerabilities, as they may not be maintained or could have known issues that have been addressed in newer versions.

**Impact:**

Using deprecated functions can lead to the following issues:
Security Risks: Deprecated functions may have known security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in newer versions. By using them, the contract could be exposed to these vulnerabilities.
Compatibility: Future updates to the Solidity language or the OpenZeppelin library may remove deprecated functions, causing the contract to become incompatible with newer versions.


**Recommended Mitigation:**

Replace Deprecated Function: Use the recommended alternative function provided by OpenZeppelin to add a new minter role. For example, if `_setupRole` is deprecated, use the `grantRole` function instead.

```diff
function addMinter(address newMinterAddress) external {
        require(msg.sender == _ownerAddress);
-       _setupRole(MINTER_ROLE, newMinterAddress);
+       grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, newMinterAddress);
    }
```
