 [*GitHub File Link*](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/AiArenaHelper.sol)



#### Admin Abuse Risks:

 `Ownership Transfer`:
 The contract allows the owner to transfer ownership, which could be a potential risk if not handled carefully. If ownership is transferred to a malicious address, it might lead to unauthorized changes in the contract state or functionality.

 `Attribute Divisor Modification`:
 The owner can modify attribute divisors, which may impact the randomness and distribution of generated attributes. Care should be taken to ensure fair and secure attribute generation.



#### Systemic Risks:

 `Ownership Dependency`:
 Several critical functions are accessible only to the owner. Any compromise or loss of access to the owner's private key may result in the loss of control over the contract.

 `Attribute Probabilities`:
 The contract heavily relies on attribute probabilities for generating attributes. Any miscalculation or manipulation of these probabilities may impact the fairness and randomness of attribute generation.

#### Technical Risks:

`Gas Limit` :
  The contract might face gas limit issues, especially during attribute generation, as it involves loops and calculations. Considerations should be made to optimize gas usage.

 `External Contract Dependency`:
The contract relies on external contracts, such as `FighterOps.sol`, for data structures and functions. Ensure that these external dependencies are secure and well-audited.


#### Integration Risks:

 `External Dependencies`:
 The contract interacts with external contracts and relies on their correct behavior. Ensure that these external dependencies are trustworthy and well-tested to prevent unexpected issues.

 `Attribute Generation`:
 Integration with other systems or contracts relying on the generated attributes may face risks if the attribute generation logic is not well-documented or understood.


#### Non-Standard Token Risks:

 `No Token Interaction`: 
The provided code does not involve the creation or management of standard ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens. However, if these contracts are part of a larger ecosystem, ensure that the interaction with tokens in other contracts is secure.


#### Additional Notes:

The contract includes functions for adding and deleting attribute probabilities, allowing flexibility in adjusting attributes for different generations.

The `createPhysicalAttributes` function is view-only and provides information about the physical attributes based on the provided DNA. Carefully validate the correctness of the generated attributes.


#### Recommendations:

Implement access control mechanisms carefully, considering potential risks associated with ownership.
Ensure that external dependencies are well-vetted and secure.
Thoroughly test the contract's attribute generation logic to ensure fairness and randomness.
