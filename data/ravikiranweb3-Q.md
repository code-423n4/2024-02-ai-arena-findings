### Neuron::claim()
The return value of transferFrom() is not check. It is a good practice to always check for return values for success and failure for token transfers.

### Neuron::mint()
The minting should be until max supply and not one less than total supply.

```
require(totalSupply() + amount < MAX_SUPPLY, "Trying to mint more than the max supply");
```
The require condition should be 
```
require(totalSupply() + amount =< MAX_SUPPLY
```

### AiArenaHelper::constructor
Duplicate initialization of attributeProbabilities mapping, once via the addAttributeProbabilities() function and another in a for loop.

```
        constructor(uint8[][] memory probabilities) {
        _ownerAddress = msg.sender;

        // Initialize the probabilities for each attribute
  ==>   addAttributeProbabilities(0, probabilities);

        uint256 attributesLength = attributes.length;
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < attributesLength; i++) {
            attributeProbabilities[0][attributes[i]] = probabilities[i];
 ==>        attributeToDnaDivisor[attributes[i]] = defaultAttributeDivisor[i];
        }
    } 

```


### GameItems::mint() 0 NFT is battery
The documentation does not provide clear outline for what is tokenId = 0 is battery. This can be derived only from VoltageManager contract and test cases.
The explanation can be improved.
