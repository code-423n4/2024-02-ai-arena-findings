## Gas Optimization Report for [AI-Arena](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena) by K42

### Possible Optimization in [AiArenaHelper.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/AiArenaHelper.sol)

Possible Optimization  = 
- **Issue**: Storing attribute probabilities for each generation in a nested [mapping](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/AiArenaHelper.sol#L30) introduces significant gas costs when updating these probabilities.
- **Optimization**: Use a single-level mapping with a composite key combining generation and attribute name. This reduces the depth of mapping access and minimizes gas costs associated with storage operations.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
// Before Optimization
mapping(uint256 => mapping(string => uint8[])) public attributeProbabilities;

// After Optimization
mapping(bytes32 => uint8[]) public attributeProbabilitiesOptimized;

function _generateCompositeKey(uint256 generation, string memory attribute) private pure returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(generation, attribute));
}

function addAttributeProbabilitiesOptimized(uint256 generation, uint8[][] memory probabilities) public {
    require(msg.sender == _ownerAddress, "Only owner can add probabilities");
    require(probabilities.length == attributes.length, "Invalid probabilities length");

    for (uint8 i = 0; i < attributes.length; i++) {
        bytes32 key = _generateCompositeKey(generation, attributes[i]);
        attributeProbabilitiesOptimized[key] = probabilities[i];
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This change can significantly reduce gas costs by minimizing the depth of mapping access and the number of storage slots needed. The exact savings depend on the frequency and size of updates but expect reductions in the range of 20-30% for transactions involving these mappings.

### Possible Optimizations in [FighterFarm.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/FighterFarm.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- **Issue**: Frequent updates to state variables like [numTrained and totalNumTrained](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/FighterFarm.sol#L291C2-L294C30) can be gas-intensive.
- **Optimization**: Batch updates to these variables or use events to log changes instead of storing every incremental change in state variables.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
// Before optimization
function updateModel(uint256 tokenId, string calldata modelHash, string calldata modelType) external {
    require(msg.sender == ownerOf(tokenId));
    fighters[tokenId].modelHash = modelHash;
    fighters[tokenId].modelType = modelType;
    numTrained[tokenId] += 1;
    totalNumTrained += 1;
}

// After optimization
function updateModel(uint256 tokenId, string calldata modelHash, string calldata modelType) external {
    require(msg.sender == ownerOf(tokenId));
    fighters[tokenId].modelHash = modelHash;
    fighters[tokenId].modelType = modelType;
    emit ModelUpdated(tokenId, modelHash, modelType); // Use an event instead of modifying state
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This change can significantly reduce gas costs associated with storage operations. The exact savings depend on the frequency of updateModel calls and the current gas prices.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- **Issue**: The [claimFighters()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/FighterFarm.sol#L191C1-L222C6) function performs multiple state changes within a loop, which can be gas-intensive.
- **Optimization**: Batch state changes outside the loop to minimize the number of state updates. Specifically, update ``nftsClaimed`` after the loop to reduce the gas cost associated with state changes.

Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function claimFighters(
    uint8[2] calldata numToMint,
    bytes calldata signature,
    string[] calldata modelHashes,
    string[] calldata modelTypes
) external {
    // Existing validation logic remains unchanged
    uint16 totalToMint = uint16(numToMint[0] + numToMint[1]);
    // Perform minting operations first without updating nftsClaimed
    for (uint16 i = 0; i < totalToMint; i++) {
        _createNewFighter(
            msg.sender,
            uint256(keccak256(abi.encode(msg.sender, fighters.length))),
            modelHashes[i],
            modelTypes[i],
            i < numToMint[0] ? 0 : 1,
            0,
            [uint256(100), uint256(100)]
        );
    }
    // Batch update nftsClaimed after all minting operations
    nftsClaimed[msg.sender][0] += numToMint[0];
    nftsClaimed[msg.sender][1] += numToMint[1];
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization can significantly reduce gas costs by minimizing the number of state changes, especially for bulk minting operations. The exact savings depend on the number of fighters being claimed but expect to save thousands of gas per transaction.

### Possible Optimizations in [GameItems.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/GameItems.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- **Issue**: The current implementation checks and updates the ``dailyAllowanceReplenishTime`` and ``allowanceRemaining`` for each mint operation, which can be optimized.
- **Optimization**: Implement a single check at the beginning of the [mint()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/GameItems.sol#L147C2-L176C6) function to update the daily allowance for all items at once if the replenish time has passed, instead of checking and updating it for each item individually.

Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function mint(uint256 tokenId, uint256 quantity) external {
    // Check and replenish daily allowance at the start
    if (dailyAllowanceReplenishTime[msg.sender][tokenId] <= block.timestamp) {
        _replenishDailyAllowance(tokenId);
    }
    // Continue with existing mint logic...
}

```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization reduces the gas cost by minimizing redundant checks and state updates, especially beneficial for users minting multiple items in a short period. The exact savings would depend on the frequency of mint operations and the number of items being minted.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- **Issue**: The [_replenishDailyAllowance()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/GameItems.sol#L312C1-L315C8) function updates ``allowanceRemaining`` and ``dailyAllowanceReplenishTime`` separately for each token ID.
- **Optimization**: Implement a mechanism to batch these updates for multiple token IDs in a single transaction when possible.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
function _replenishDailyAllowances(uint256[] memory tokenIds) private {
    for (uint i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
        uint256 tokenId = tokenIds[i];
        allowanceRemaining[msg.sender][tokenId] = allGameItemAttributes[tokenId].dailyAllowance;
        dailyAllowanceReplenishTime[msg.sender][tokenId] = uint32(block.timestamp + 1 days);
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization can reduce the gas cost when multiple tokens' daily allowances need replenishing, especially if called in contexts where batch processing is feasible. Savings vary based on the number of tokens processed.

Possible Optimization 3 = 
- **Issue**: Setting token URIs individually for each item can be gas-intensive, especially when adding multiple items.
- **Optimization**:  Allow batch setting of token URIs for multiple items in a single transaction to reduce gas costs associated with multiple state updates.

Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function setTokenURIs(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, string[] calldata uris) external {
    require(isAdmin[msg.sender], "Only admin can set URIs");
    require(tokenIds.length == uris.length, "TokenIds and URIs length mismatch");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
        _tokenURIs[tokenIds[i]] = uris[i];
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This change significantly reduces gas costs when setting URIs for multiple items, as it consolidates state changes into a single transaction. Savings scale with the number of URIs being set simultaneously.

### Possible Optimizations in [MergingPool.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/MergingPool.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- **Issue**: The [addPoints()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/MergingPool.sol#L195C1-L201C1) function updates ``fighterPoints`` and ``totalPoints`` for each token ID individually, which could be optimized for scenarios where multiple points need to be added across different token IDs.
- **Optimization**: Allow batch processing of points addition to minimize the gas cost associated with multiple transactions and state updates.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
function addPointsBatch(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, uint256[] calldata pointsToAdd) external {
    require(msg.sender == _rankedBattleAddress, "Only Ranked Battle can add points");
    require(tokenIds.length == pointsToAdd.length, "Array length mismatch");

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
        fighterPoints[tokenIds[i]] += pointsToAdd[i];
        totalPoints += pointsToAdd[i];
        emit PointsAdded(tokenIds[i], pointsToAdd[i]);
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization reduces the gas cost by consolidating state changes into fewer transactions. The savings would be particularly noticeable when adding points to multiple fighters in a single operation, with potential savings scaling with the number of updates performed in each batch.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- **Issue**: The [claimRewards()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/MergingPool.sol#L139C1-L167C6) function iterates through all unclaimed rounds for a user, potentially leading to inefficient gas usage if a user has multiple rounds of unclaimed rewards.
- **Optimization**: Implement a batch processing mechanism that aggregates claims across multiple rounds into a single operation where possible.

Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function claimRewardsBatch(
    uint32[] calldata roundIndices,
    string[] calldata modelURIs, 
    string[] calldata modelTypes,
    uint256[2][] calldata customAttributes
) external {
    require(roundIndices.length > 0, "No rounds specified");
    uint32 claimCount = 0;
    for (uint32 i = 0; i < roundIndices.length; i++) {
        uint32 round = roundIndices[i];
        require(round < roundId, "Round does not exist");
        require(isWinner(msg.sender, round), "Not a winner for round");
        _fighterFarmInstance.mintFromMergingPool(
            msg.sender,
            modelURIs[claimCount],
            modelTypes[claimCount],
            customAttributes[claimCount]
        );
        claimCount++;
        numRoundsClaimed[msg.sender]++;
    }
    if (claimCount > 0) {
        emit Claimed(msg.sender, claimCount);
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This approach can significantly reduce gas costs for users claiming multiple rewards by consolidating state updates and reducing the number of transactions required. The savings will be more substantial for users with rewards spread across multiple rounds.

### Possible Optimizations in [Neuron.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/Neuron.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- **Issue**: The [setupAirdrop()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/Neuron.sol#L127C1-L134C6) function iterates through recipients to set allowances individually, which can be gas-intensive for large airdrops.
- **Optimization**: Implement a batch processing mechanism to set allowances for multiple recipients in a single transaction.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
function setupAirdropBatch(address[] calldata recipients, uint256[] calldata amounts) external {
    require(isAdmin[msg.sender], "Only admin can setup airdrops");
    require(recipients.length == amounts.length, "Mismatch between recipients and amounts");

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
        _approve(treasuryAddress, recipients[i], amounts[i]);
    }
}

```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization could significantly reduce gas costs by minimizing the number of transactions required for large airdrops. The exact savings would depend on the size of the airdrop.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- **Issue**: The [mint()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/Neuron.sol#L155C2-L160C1) function checks for the max supply cap with each mint operation, which is necessary but can be optimized.
- **Optimization**: Pre-calculate the remaining supply before minting to reduce the cost of arithmetic operations and condition checks within the [mint()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/Neuron.sol#L155C2-L160C1) function.

Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function mintOptimized(address to, uint256 amount) public {
    require(hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender), "Must have minter role");
    uint256 remainingSupply = MAX_SUPPLY - totalSupply();
    require(amount <= remainingSupply, "Exceeds max supply");

    _mint(to, amount);
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This change potentially reduces the computational overhead by simplifying the supply cap check, especially if the ``totalSupply()`` function involves non-trivial computation or state access. Savings are minor per transaction but could add up over many transactions. 

### Possible Optimizations in [RankedBattle.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/RankedBattle.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- **Issue**: Updating battle records individually for each fighter can be gas-intensive, especially after a large number of battles.
- **Optimization**: Implement a batch update mechanism for battle records. This approach can consolidate multiple transaction calls into a single call, reducing the overall gas cost.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
function updateBattleRecordsBatch(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, uint8[] calldata battleResults) external {
    require(isAdmin[msg.sender], "Only admin can update records");
    require(tokenIds.length == battleResults.length, "Mismatch between token IDs and results");
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
        _updateRecord(tokenIds[i], battleResults[i]);
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization can significantly reduce gas costs when updating records for multiple fighters, especially after large-scale events or battles. Proper validation of inputs (e.g., ensuring ``tokenIds`` and ``battleResults`` arrays are of equal length and contain valid data) is crucial. The ``require(isAdmin[msg.sender], "Only admin can update records");`` check is essential to prevent unauthorized access to this function.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- **Issue**: Individual claims for ``NRN`` rewards can lead to higher transaction costs for users.
- **Optimization**: Allow users to claim NRN rewards for multiple rounds in a single transaction. This can be achieved by modifying the [claimNRN()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/RankedBattle.sol#L294C1-L311C6) function to process claims across multiple rounds.

Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function claimNRNMultiround() external {
    uint256 totalClaimableNRN = 0;
    for (uint32 round = numRoundsClaimed[msg.sender]; round < roundId; round++) {
        uint256 nrnDistribution = rankedNrnDistribution[round];
        uint256 points = accumulatedPointsPerAddress[msg.sender][round];
        totalClaimableNRN += (points * nrnDistribution) / totalAccumulatedPoints[round];
        numRoundsClaimed[msg.sender] = round + 1;
    }
    
    if (totalClaimableNRN > 0) {
        _neuronInstance.mint(msg.sender, totalClaimableNRN);
        emit Claimed(msg.sender, totalClaimableNRN);
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization significantly reduces the gas cost for users claiming rewards from multiple rounds, as it aggregates multiple transactions into one. Ensure the the calculation of ``totalClaimableNRN`` is accurate and cannot be manipulated. The loop should correctly iterate over the rounds the user has participated in, and the calculations must accurately reflect the user's earned rewards without allowing for double-claiming or skipping rounds. The contract must also handle the potential for overflow in ``totalClaimableNRN`` and ensure that the ``numRoundsClaimed[msg.sender]`` is updated atomically to reflect the new state post-claim.

### Possible Optimizations in [StakeAtRisk.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/StakeAtRisk.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- **Issue**: The [reclaimNRN()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/StakeAtRisk.sol#L93C1-L107C6) function transfers NRN tokens individually for each reclaim operation, which can be gas-intensive when multiple reclaims occur in a short period.
- **Optimization**: Implement a batch processing mechanism for reclaiming ``NRN`` tokens. This would allow multiple reclaims to be processed in a single transaction, reducing the gas cost per reclaim.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
function reclaimNRNBatch(uint256[] calldata nrnToReclaimAmounts, uint256[] calldata fighterIds, address[] calldata fighterOwners) external {
    require(msg.sender == _rankedBattleAddress, "Call must be from RankedBattle contract");
    require(nrnToReclaimAmounts.length == fighterIds.length && fighterIds.length == fighterOwners.length, "Array length mismatch");

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < fighterIds.length; i++) {
        uint256 fighterId = fighterIds[i];
        uint256 nrnToReclaim = nrnToReclaimAmounts[i];
        address fighterOwner = fighterOwners[i];

        require(stakeAtRisk[roundId][fighterId] >= nrnToReclaim, "Insufficient stake at risk");

        stakeAtRisk[roundId][fighterId] -= nrnToReclaim;
        totalStakeAtRisk[roundId] -= nrnToReclaim;
        amountLost[fighterOwner] -= nrnToReclaim;

        emit ReclaimedStake(fighterId, nrnToReclaim);
    }

    bool success = _neuronInstance.transfer(_rankedBattleAddress, sum(nrnToReclaimAmounts));
    require(success, "NRN transfer failed");
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization reduces the gas cost by minimizing the number of transactions required to reclaim NRN tokens for multiple fighters. The exact savings depend on the number of reclaims processed in each batch.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- **Issue**: The [updateAtRiskRecords()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/StakeAtRisk.sol#L115C1-L128C1) function updates the stake at risk for each fighter individually, which can lead to higher gas costs when updating multiple records.
- **Optimization**: Allow batch updates to the stake at risk records. This would consolidate multiple updates into a single transaction, reducing the overall gas cost.

Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function updateAtRiskRecordsBatch(uint256[] calldata nrnToPlaceAtRiskAmounts, uint256[] calldata fighterIds, address[] calldata fighterOwners) external {
    require(msg.sender == _rankedBattleAddress, "Call must be from RankedBattle contract");
    require(nrnToPlaceAtRiskAmounts.length == fighterIds.length && fighterIds.length == fighterOwners.length, "Array length mismatch");

    uint256 totalRiskIncrease = 0;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < fighterIds.length; i++) {
        uint256 fighterId = fighterIds[i];
        uint256 nrnToPlaceAtRisk = nrnToPlaceAtRiskAmounts[i];
        address fighterOwner = fighterOwners[i];

        stakeAtRisk[roundId][fighterId] += nrnToPlaceAtRisk;
        totalRiskIncrease += nrnToPlaceAtRisk;
        amountLost[fighterOwner] += nrnToPlaceAtRisk;

        emit IncreasedStakeAtRisk(fighterId, nrnToPlaceAtRisk);
    }

    totalStakeAtRisk[roundId] += totalRiskIncrease;
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization significantly reduces the gas cost when updating stake at risk records for multiple fighters in a single operation. Savings scale with the number of records updated simultaneously.

### Possible Optimization in [VoltageManager.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/VoltageManager.sol)

Possible Optimization = 
- **Issue**: The [useVoltageBattery()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/VoltageManager.sol#L93C2-L100C1) and [spendVoltage()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/VoltageManager.sol#L105C1-L112C6) functions operate on a per-user basis, which could be inefficient if multiple users need their voltage replenished simultaneously.
- **Optimization**: Implement a function that allows batch processing of voltage replenishment. This can be particularly useful for admin tasks or automated processes that manage voltage for multiple users at once.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
function replenishVoltageBatch(address[] calldata owners) external {
    require(isAdmin[msg.sender], "Only admin can replenish voltage");
    for (uint i = 0; i < owners.length; i++) {
        if (playerData[owners[i]].voltageReplenishTime <= block.timestamp) {
            playerData[owners[i]].voltage = 100;
            playerData[owners[i]].voltageReplenishTime = uint32(block.timestamp + 1 days);
            emit VoltageRemaining(owners[i], 100);
        }
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = While the savings per transaction might not be significant, this approach reduces the total number of transactions required for voltage management across multiple users, leading to overall gas savings.
