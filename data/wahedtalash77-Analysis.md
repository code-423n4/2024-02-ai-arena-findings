# Overview

AI Arena is a PvP platform fighting game where the fighters are AIs that were trained by humans.
There are two distinct and complementary competitions that power the platform:

1 - Research Competition

Researchers from around the world compete to create the best Machine Learning (ML) model to battle in the game.

2- Gaming Competition.

Gamers from around the world compete to develop the optimal training strategy to maximize their NFTâ€™s performance in the Arena.Gamers also have the opportunity to win new NFTs through the Merging Pool, further improving their chances for global domination.

the Native token is **Neuron ($NRN)**
