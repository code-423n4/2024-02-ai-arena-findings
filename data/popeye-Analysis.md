## Overview:

AI Arena introduces a unique PvP platform fighting game paradigm, where the combatants are AI entities trained by players, bringing a novel twist to the blockchain gaming landscape. This game leverages the Ethereum blockchain to tokenize fighters through the `FighterFarm.sol` smart contract, embedding a rich array of attributes within each NFT. These attributes include physical appearance, battle characteristics, and unique abilities, delineated as follows:

- **Physical Attributes & Generation**: These define the fighter's visual identity, contributing to a diverse and visually engaging roster of characters.
- **Weight**: A key determinant of a fighter's performance in combat, influencing their agility and strength.
- **Element**: Each fighter possesses elemental abilities, providing strategic depth and variety to battles.
- **Fighter Type**: Distinguishes between different classes of fighters, such as Champions or Dendroids, each with unique capabilities.
- **Model Data**: Encapsulates the fighter's digital essence through a model type and hash, ensuring uniqueness and authenticity.

Through participation in ranked battles, players have the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of `$NRN`, an ERC20 token defined by the `Neuron.sol` smart contract. The game's architecture assigns specific roles to smart contracts to facilitate its reward system and in-game economy:

- **RankedBattle.sol**: Granted the MINTER and STAKER roles, this contract is central to the game's reward distribution mechanism.
- **FighterFarm.sol and GameItems.sol**: These contracts receive the SPENDER role, enabling players to make in-game purchases using $NRN tokens.

A distinctive feature of AI Arena is its staking mechanism. Players must stake `$NRN` tokens to participate in ranked battles, with the potential for rewards based on performance. Notably, there is a risk of losing a portion of their stake if they perform poorly. The game introduces a `stakingFactor`, calculated from the square root of the staked amount, to ensure a level playing field, affecting the points calculation after each match.

Another innovative aspect is the `voltage` system, a form of energy that each player must manage. Voltage is replenished daily but is consumed with each ranked battle. Players facing depletion must either wait for replenishment or purchase batteries through the GameItems.sol contract to immediately restore their voltage.

It is important to highlight that AI Arena's core game logic is executed **off-chain**, with the game server acting as an oracle for determining ranked match outcomes. This hybrid approach raises considerations regarding the integration of off-chain and on-chain elements, particularly in terms of security, transparency, and trust.
