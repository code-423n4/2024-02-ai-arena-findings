## Overview

AI Arena is a PvP platform fighting game where the fighters are AIs that were trained by humans. It is a platform fighting game, where the objective is to knock your opponent off of a platform. The game works like this: you train your NFT character through Imitation Learning, where the AI learns to play the game by copying your actions. When you feel your character is ready to fight, you submit the NFT into the arena to compete in Ranked Battle. Your NFT then fights autonomously against opponents near its skill level. The game allows you to create your own personalized fighter AI, with custom attributes with ownership control and attribute manipulation functionalities, and also allows you to stake on fighter NFTs for rewards.


## Key Contracts

The key contracts of Ai arena protocol for this Audit are:

These contracts are central to the functionality, security, and main logic of the Ai arena protocol. Focusing on them first will provide a solid foundation for understanding the protocol's operation and how it manages user assets and stability.

- **FighterFarm.sol**: The FighterFarm contract manages the creation, ownership, and redemption of AI Arena Fighter NFTs, including the ability to mint new NFTs from a merging pool or through the redemption of mint passes.

- **RankedBattle.sol**: RankedBattle contract provides functionality for staking NRN tokens on fighters, tracking battle records, calculating and distributing rewards based on battle outcomes and staked amounts, and allowing claiming of accumulated rewards.

- **Neuron.sol**: The Neuron token is used for various functions within the platform, including staking, governance, and rewards.


## Scope

- **AiArenaHelper.sol**: this contract serves as a backbone for managing and generating diverse fighter attributes within the AI Arena game ecosystem. This contract provides functions to create fighter attributes based on given parameters.

- **FighterOps.sol**: This library containing metadata about Fighter struct and contains methods for fetching information about a fighter.

- **GameItems.sol**: This contract represents a collection of game items used in AI Arena. These items provide the game more functionality and interactivity.

- **MergingPool.sol**: This contract allows users to potentially earn a new fighter NFT. Users can win an NFT by staking in this merging pool contract.

- **StakeAtRisk.sol**: The StakeAtRisk contract allows the RankedBattle contract to manage the staking of NRN tokens at risk during battles. This contract plays a crucial role in handling the risk and rewards associated with NRNs within the game ecosystem.

- **VoltageManager.sol**: This contract allows the management of voltage for game items and provides functions for using and replenishing voltage.


## Approach Taken in Evaluating The Open Dollar Protocol

Accordingly, I analyzed and audited the subject in the following steps:

1. **Core Protocol Contract Overview**:

   I focused on thoroughly understanding the codebase and providing recommendations to improve its functionality.
   The main goal was to take a close look at the important contracts and how they work together in the AI arena protocol.

   **Main Contracts I Looked At**

               AiArenaHelper.sol
               FighterFarm.sol
               GameItems.sol
               MergingPool.sol
               Neuron.sol
               RankedBattle.sol
               StakeAtRisk.sol
               VoltageManager.sol

   I started my analysis by examining the FighterFarm.sol contract. Audit the FighterFarm contract first as it has a central role in enabling the creation, ownership, and redemption of Ai arena Fighter NFTs from minting from a merging pool or redeeming from mint passes. The contract essentially helps users to claim a predetermined number of fighters & Burns multiple mint passes in exchange for fighter NFTs. The contract allows updating the staking status of the fighter associated with the given token ID as well as, updating the model for the specified token ID. Also, another main functionality of the contract includes creating the base attributes for the fighter with user-specified DNA and fighter type along with Creating a new fighter and minting an NFT to the specified address.

   Then, I turned our attention to the RankedBattle.sol contract second because it manages functionality for staking NRN tokens on fighters, tracking battle records, calculating and distributing rewards based on battle outcomes. The reliability of the workflow of this contract is crucial for accurate protocol operation.

   Then I looked at GameItems.sol because it closely goes alongside both the contracts I looked at earlier. contract designed for managing game items in the AI Arena game. The contract provides flexibility for game item management, including finite supply, transferability, and daily allowances.

   Then audit `MergingPool`, which is used to earn a new fighter NFT by points accumulated by their fighters. `Neuron` contract is an ERC20 token contract representing Neuron (NRN) tokens. The Neuron token is used for AI Arena's in-game economy. Moving on to `AiArenaHelper` which generates and manages an AI Arena fighter's physical attribute, also adding and deleting probabilities for a given generation.

   And `StakeAtRisk` contract because it deals with NRNs that are at risk of being lost during a round of competition. Vulnerabilities in this contract could have significant financial implications and then `VoltageManager` contract, which contains core actions related to managing the voltage system for AI Arena. It's important to ensure the security of these actions.

2. **Documentation Review**:

   Then went to Review [This Docs](https://docs.aiarena.io/gaming-competition) for a more detailed and technical explanation of Open Dollar.


3. **Manual Code Review**: In this phase, I initially conducted a line-by-line analysis, following that, I engaged in a comparison mode.

   - **Line by Line Analysis**: Pay close attention to the contract's intended functionality and compare it with its actual behavior on a line-by-line basis.

   - **Comparison Mode**: Compare the implementation of each function with established standards or existing implementations, focusing on the function names to identify any deviations.

### Architecture Feedback

**Comments and Documentation**: While the codebase contains comments, improving the quality of comments and documentation can enhance code readability. Consider using more explanatory comments to clarify the purpose and functionality of each section of the code. This will make it easier for other developers and auditors to understand and maintain the code.

**Decimals Handling**: When working with decimals, ensure that all conversions are handled accurately.

**Formal Verification**: Consider a professional formal verification of the contract to identify and mitigate any security risks.

Overall the codebase quality deserves a high-quality rank.

## Codebase Quality

Overall, I consider the quality of the Open Dollar codebase to be excellent. The code appears to be very mature and well-developed. We have noticed the implementation of

 various standards adhere to appropriately. Details are explained below:

| Codebase Quality Categories              | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Maintainability and Reliability** | The codebase demonstrates moderate maintainability with well-structured functions and comments, promoting readability. It exhibits reliability through defensive programming practices, parameter validation, and handling external calls safely. The use of internal functions for related operations enhances code modularity, reducing duplication. Libraries improve reliability by minimizing arithmetic errors. Adherence to standard conventions and practices contributes to overall code quality. However, full reliability depends on external contract implementations like OpenZeppelin.                                                                       |
| **Code Comments**                        | The contracts have comments that are used to explain the purpose and functionality of different parts of the contracts, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code. The comments provide descriptions of methods, variables, and the overall structure of the contract. The imported interfaces and contracts are declared, and the contract's title and purpose are described. Although code comments are written correctly a lack of detailing is evident.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Documentation**                        | The documentation of the Ai Arena project is quite comprehensive and detailed, providing a solid overview of how Ai Arena is structured and how its various aspects function. However, we have noticed that there is room for additional details, such as diagrams, to gain a deeper understanding of how different contracts interact and the functions they implement. With considerable enthusiasm. We are confident that these diagrams will bring significant value to the protocol as they can be seamlessly integrated into the existing documentation, enriching it and providing a more comprehensive and detailed understanding for users, developers, and auditors. |
| **Testing**                              | The audit scope of the contracts to be audited is decent but it should be aimed to be 100%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Code Structure and Formatting**        | The codebase contracts are well-structured and formatted. It inherits from multiple components, adhering, for example, to OpenZeppelin standards in some contracts. The constructors initialize the contract with parameters and inherited components. Override functions for each component are provided with accompanying comments explaining their purpose. The code is organized, making it readable and maintainable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Systemic & Centralization Risks

The analysis provided highlights several significant systemic and centralization risks present in the Ai arena protocol. These risks encompass concentration risk, third-party dependency risk, Additionally, the absence of fuzzing and invariant tests could also pose risks to the protocol’s security.

Here's an analysis of potential systemic and centralization risks in the provided contracts:

## Centralization risks
There are not many centralization points in the system, which is a good sign. The following mentions the only but the most important trust assumption in the codebase:

1. ## Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in src/Neuron.sol [Line: 11](src/Neuron.sol#L11)

    ```solidity
    contract Neuron is ERC20, AccessControl {
    ```
2. ## M-2: Using `ERC721::_mint()` can be dangerous

Using `ERC721::_mint()` can mint ERC721 tokens to addresses that don't support ERC721 tokens. Use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()` for ERC721.

- Found in src/GameItems.sol [Line: 173](src/GameItems.sol#L173)

    ```solidity
                _mint(msg.sender, tokenId, quantity, bytes("random"));
    ```

- Found in src/Neuron.sol [Line: 74](src/Neuron.sol#L74)

    ```solidity
            _mint(treasuryAddress, INITIAL_TREASURY_MINT);
    ```

- Found in src/Neuron.sol [Line: 75](src/Neuron.sol#L75)

    ```solidity
            _mint(contributorAddress, INITIAL_CONTRIBUTOR_MINT);
    ```

- Found in src/Neuron.sol [Line: 158](src/Neuron.sol#L158)

    ```solidity
            _mint(to, amount);
    ```

3. **No having, fuzzing, and invariant tests could open the door to future vulnerabilities**.

**Properly managing these risks and implementing best practices in security and decentralization will contribute to the sustainability and long-term success of the Open Dollar protocol.**

In general, the AI Arena project exhibits an interesting and well-developed architecture. We believe the team has done a good job regarding the code, but the identified risks need to be addressed, and measures should be implemented to protect the protocol from potential malicious use cases. Additionally, it is recommended to improve the documentation and comments in the code to enhance understanding and collaboration among developers. It is also highly recommended that the team continues to invest in security measures such as mitigation reviews, audits, and bug bounty programs to maintain the security and reliability of the project.
