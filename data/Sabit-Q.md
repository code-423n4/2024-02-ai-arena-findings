1. setAllowedBurningAddresses function can add one address multiple times

The issue is that setAllowedBurningAddresses can be called multiple times with the same address, resulting in duplicate entries in the allowedBurningAddresses mapping. This should be prevented by first checking if the address already exists before setting it.

2. winnersPerPeriod Can Be Set to Zero in updateWinnersPerPeriod

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/cd1a0e6d1b40168657d1aaee8223dc050e15f8cc/src/MergingPool.sol#L106-L109

The updateWinnersPerPeriod function allows setting the winnersPerPeriod variable to zero, which can lead to issues in the contract logic.

3. Functions allows duplication of addresses

The addMinter, addStaker, and addSpender functions allow duplicate entries for the same address in their respective role.

However, there is no check to prevent adding the same address multiple times. For example, calling addMinter(0x123) twice would add that address as a minter two times.
