1. setAllowedBurningAddresses function can add one address multiple times

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/cd1a0e6d1b40168657d1aaee8223dc050e15f8cc/src/GameItems.sol#L185-L189

The issue is that setAllowedBurningAddresses can be called multiple times with the same address, resulting in duplicate entries in the allowedBurningAddresses mapping. This should be prevented by first checking if the address already exists before setting it.

2. winnersPerPeriod Can Be Set to Zero in updateWinnersPerPeriod

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/cd1a0e6d1b40168657d1aaee8223dc050e15f8cc/src/MergingPool.sol#L106-L109

The updateWinnersPerPeriod function allows setting the winnersPerPeriod variable to zero, which can lead to issues in the contract logic.
