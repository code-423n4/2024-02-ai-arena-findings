## Contracts Overview & Mechanism Review 

### 1 . AiArenaHelper.sol

The AiArenaHelper  is designed to manage the physical attributes of AI Arena fighters. It includes functionality to handle ownership, attribute probability management, and the creation of fighter attributes based on DNA. The contract uses mappings to track the probabilities of fighter attributes for different generations and to associate attributes with DNA divisors.


**Mechanism Review**


**I . Ownership Mechanism**
- The contract has an _ownerAddress state variable that represents the current owner.
- The transferOwnership function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address. This function can only be called by the current owner.

**II . Attribute Management Mechanism**
- The contract maintains a list of attributes (attributes) and default DNA divisors (defaultAttributeDivisor) for these attributes.
- The attributeToDnaDivisor mapping associates each attribute with a divisor that is used in the DNA calculation.
- The attributeProbabilities mapping stores the probabilities for each attribute for different generations of fighters.

**III . Attribute Probability Mechanism**
- The addAttributeProbabilities function allows the owner to set the probabilities for each attribute for a given generation.
- The deleteAttributeProbabilities function allows the owner to delete the probabilities for a given generation.
- The getAttributeProbabilities function retrieves the probabilities for a specific attribute and generation.

**IV . Fighter Attribute Creation Mechanism**
- The createPhysicalAttributes function generates physical attributes for a fighter based on their DNA, generation, icons type, and dendroid status.
- If the fighter is a dendroid, it receives a fixed set of attributes.
- If the fighter is not a dendroid, the function calculates the attributes based on DNA and the probabilities for the fighter's generation.
- Special cases for icons type are handled, where certain attributes are set to a fixed value.

**v . DNA to Index Conversion Mechanism

- The dnaToIndex function converts a fighter's DNA and rarity rank into an attribute probability index.
- It uses the cumulative probability approach to determine which attribute index corresponds to the given rarity rank.







### 2 . FighterFarm.sol	

The FighterFarm  is an ERC721-compliant smart contract designed to manage AI Arena Fighter NFTs. It allows users to mint, claim, and manage fighter NFTs, which are associated with machine learning models. The contract includes features such as locking fighters (preventing trades while staked), rerolling fighters to change their attributes, and burning mint passes to create new fighters.


**Mechanism Review**

**I . Ownership and Access Control**
- The contract has an owner (_ownerAddress) who has the authority to transfer ownership, increment generation, add stakers, and set various contract addresses.
- A delegated address (_delegatedAddress) is responsible for setting token URIs and verifying claim messages.

**II . Minting and Claiming Fighters**
- Users can claim fighters by providing a signature from the delegated address, which is verified on-chain.
- Fighters can also be minted by burning mint passes (redeemMintPass function), which requires the caller to be the owner of the mint pass.

**III . Rerolling Fighters**
- Owners of fighters can reroll their NFTs to receive new attributes, at the cost of $NRN tokens. The number of rerolls is limited per fighter type.

**Iv . Staking and Locking Mechanism**
- Fighters can be staked, which is represented by a locked state in the contract. Staked fighters cannot be transferred.
- Only addresses with the staker role can update the staking status of fighters.

**V . Generation and Reroll Management**
- The contract tracks generations for each fighter type, which can be incremented by the owner.
- The maximum number of rerolls allowed is also managed and can be increased with each generation.

**VI . External Contract Interactions**
- The contract interacts with AiArenaHelper for creating physical attributes of fighters.
- It uses AAMintPass for burning mint passes and Neuron for handling the $NRN token transactions.

**VII . NFT Transfer Restrictions**
- Custom checks are in place to ensure that fighters are not transferred if they are staked or if the recipient already owns the maximum number of fighters allowed.

**VIII . Metadata Management**
- Token URIs can be set by the delegated address, allowing for dynamic metadata updates.

**IX . Training and Model Updates**
- Fighter owners can update the machine learning model associated with their fighter, which increments the training count.

**X . Minting from Merging Pool**
- A merging pool address can mint new fighters directly, bypassing the usual minting mechanisms.

**XI . ERC721 Compliance**
- The contract inherits from ERC721 and ERC721Enumerable, ensuring compliance with the ERC721 standard for NFTs.

**XII . Contract Metadata**
- A contractURI function is provided to return the metadata of the contract itself.


### 3 . FighterOps.sol


 Fighterops  library manages the creation and information retrieval of Fighter NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). It includes events, structs, and functions that handle the attributes and information of these fighters.




**Mechanism Review**

**I . Events**
- This event is emitted when a new Fighter NFT is created. It logs the id, weight, element, and generation of the fighter.

II . Structs
-  struct holds the physical attributes of a fighter, such as head, eyes, mouth, body, hands, and feet.
-  struct represents a Fighter NFT and includes the fighter's weight, element, physicalAttributes, id, modelHash, modelType, generation, iconsType, and a boolean dendroidBool.

**III . Public Functions**
- `fighterCreatedEmitter`: This function emits the FighterCreated event. It is marked as public, which means it can be called by anyone, but its intended use is not clear from the provided code.
- `getFighterAttributes`: This function takes a Fighter struct as input and returns an array of the fighter's physical attributes. It is a view function, meaning it does not modify the state and can be called without incurring gas costs (except when called by a transaction).
- `viewFighterInfo`: This function provides a comprehensive view of a fighter's information, including the owner's address, physical attributes, weight, element, model hash, model type, and generation. It is also a view function.


### 4 . GameItems.sol

The GameItems contract is an ERC1155 implementation designed for a gaming ecosystem, specifically for AI Arena by ArenaX Labs Inc. It manages a collection of game items with attributes such as name, supply constraints, transferability, remaining items, price, and daily allowance. The contract includes functionality for minting, burning, and transferring items, with additional controls over these actions.


**Mechanism Review**

**I . Ownership and Admin Control**
- The contract has an _ownerAddress that is set upon deployment and can be transferred using transferOwnership.
- The isAdmin mapping allows the owner to grant or revoke admin privileges to other addresses using adjustAdminAccess.

**II . Game Item Management**
- Game items are represented by GameItemAttributes structs, which include metadata and rules for each item.
- Admins can create new game items with createGameItem, specifying attributes like name, supply, price, and daily allowance.
- The adjustTransferability function allows the owner to lock or unlock the transferability of specific game items.

**III . Minting Mechanism**
- Users can mint new game items using the mint function, which requires sufficient balance of the Neuron token (_neuronInstance).
- Minting is subject to checks on the item's finite supply, the user's daily allowance, and the user's Neuron token balance.
- The daily allowance is managed through allowanceRemaining and dailyAllowanceReplenishTime mappings, with replenishment handled by _replenishDailyAllowance.

**IV . Burning Mechanism**
- Certain addresses can be allowed to burn game items using setAllowedBurningAddresses.
- The burn function allows these addresses to destroy a specified amount of game items from an account.

**V . Transfer Mechanism**
- The safeTransferFrom function is overridden to include a check for the transferability of the game item before allowing the transfer.


**VI . Token URI Management**
- The contract allows admins to set custom URIs for each game item using setTokenURI.
- The uri function is overridden to return these custom URIs or the default URI if not set.

**VII . Query Functions**
- The contract includes various public and external view functions to query the state, such as contractURI, uri, getAllowanceRemaining, remainingSupply, and uniqueTokensOutstanding.

**VIII . Event Logging**
- Events like BoughtItem, Locked, and Unlocked are emitted to log significant actions and state changes.

### 5 . MergingPool.sol

The MergingPool contract is designed to work within a gaming ecosystem, specifically allowing users to earn new fighter NFTs. It interacts with a FighterFarm contract to mint NFTs for winners of a competition period. The contract keeps track of points assigned to fighters, which are presumably tokens representing characters in a game, and allows for the selection of winners based on these points.


**Mechanism Review**

**I . Ownership and Admin Control**
- The contract has an owner (_ownerAddress) who has the authority to transfer ownership (transferOwnership) and adjust admin access (adjustAdminAccess).
- Admins have the ability to update the number of winners per period (updateWinnersPerPeriod) and select winners (pickWinner).

**II . Points System**
- Points can be added to fighters (addPoints) by the ranked battle contract, which is the only address authorized to call this function.
- The total points (totalPoints) are tracked, as well as individual fighter points (fighterPoints).

**III . Winner Selection**
- Admins can pick winners for the current round using the pickWinner function. This function checks that the correct number of winners is provided and that winners have not already been selected for the current round.
- When winners are picked, their points are reset to zero, and the totalPoints are adjusted accordingly.
- The winnerAddresses mapping is updated with the addresses of the winners, and the isSelectionComplete mapping is set to true for the current round.

**IV . Claiming Rewards**
- Users can claim rewards for multiple rounds using the claimRewards function. This function iterates through the rounds and checks if the user's address is listed as a winner.
- If the user is a winner, the FighterFarm contract is called to mint a new NFT with the provided modelURIs, modelTypes, and customAttributes.
- The numRoundsClaimed mapping is updated to prevent users from claiming the same round multiple times.

**V . Querying Unclaimed Rewards**
- The getUnclaimedRewards function allows users to check how many unclaimed rewards they have by iterating through the rounds and counting the number of times their address appears as a winner.

**VI . Points Retrieval**
- The getFighterPoints function allows retrieval of points for multiple fighters up to a specified maximum token ID. However, there is a bug in the implementation as it initializes an array of size 1 but attempts to fill it with more elements.

**VII . Event Emission**
- The contract emits events (PointsAdded and Claimed) when points are added or rewards are claimed, which is useful for tracking these actions off-chain.

### 6 . Neuron.sol	

 The Neuron Contract  is an ERC20 token contract representing Neuron (NRN) tokens. This token is intended for use within the AI Arena's in-game economy. The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC20 and AccessControl contracts, leveraging their robust implementations for standard token functionality and role-based permissioning.


**Mechanism Review**

**I . Roles and Permissions**
- The contract uses OpenZeppelin's AccessControl to manage roles and permissions. There are three custom roles defined:
 `MINTER_ROLE`: Allows addresses with this role to mint new tokens, up to the maximum supply.
 `SPENDER_ROLE`: Allows addresses with this role to approve token allowances for other addresses.
 `STAKER_ROLE`: Allows addresses with this role to approve token allowances for staking purposes.

- The contract owner can assign these roles to different addresses, granting them specific permissions.

**II . Initial Minting**
- Upon deployment, the constructor mints an initial supply of tokens to two addresses: the treasury and a contributor address. The amounts are defined by INITIAL_TREASURY_MINT and INITIAL_CONTRIBUTOR_MINT, respectively.

**III . Ownership Transfer**
- The transferOwnership function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address. This function does not have an onlyOwner modifier but instead checks that msg.sender is the current owner.

**IV . Role Management**
- The contract owner can add new minters, stakers, and spenders using the addMinter, addStaker, and addSpender functions, respectively. These functions also lack an onlyOwner modifier but check that msg.sender is the owner.

**V . Admin Access**
- The adjustAdminAccess function allows the owner to grant or revoke admin status to any address. Admins can set up airdrops using the setupAirdrop function.

**VI . Airdrop Setup**
- The setupAirdrop function allows an admin to set up allowances from the treasury to multiple recipients in a single transaction. This is done by approving the treasury to spend a specific amount of tokens on behalf of each recipient.

**VII . Token Claiming**
- Users can claim tokens from the treasury using the claim function, provided there is enough allowance set up for them. The function transfers the claimed tokens from the treasury to the caller's address.

**VIII . Minting and Burning**
- The mint function allows addresses with the MINTER_ROLE to mint new tokens to a specified address. The burn function allows any token holder to burn their tokens, reducing the total supply. The burnFrom function allows an address to burn tokens from another address, given sufficient allowance.

**IX . Approvals**
- The approveSpender and approveStaker functions allow addresses with the SPENDER_ROLE and STAKER_ROLE, respectively, to approve allowances for other addresses.


### 7 . RankedBattle.sol

The RankedBattle contract is designed to manage a staking and battle system for fighters represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Users can stake NRN tokens on fighters, participate in battles, and earn rewards based on the outcomes of these battles. The contract includes mechanisms for staking, unstaking, claiming rewards, and updating battle records. 


**Mechanism Review**

**I . Staking Mechanism**
- Users can stake NRN tokens on fighters using the stakeNRN function. The function checks if the user owns the fighter, has enough NRN tokens, and has not unstaked in the current round.
- The staked amount is recorded in amountStaked, and the global staked amount is updated.
- The stakingFactor for the fighter is calculated based on the staked amount and any stake at risk, which influences the points earned from battles.

**II . Unstaking Mechanism**
- Users can unstake NRN tokens from fighters using the unstakeNRN function. The function checks if the user owns the fighter.
- The unstaked amount is subtracted from amountStaked, and the global staked amount is updated.
- The stakingFactor is recalculated, and a flag hasUnstaked is set to prevent further staking in the current round.

**III . Claiming Rewards**
- Users can claim their accumulated NRN rewards using the claimNRN function. Rewards are calculated based on the user's accumulated points and the NRN distribution for each round.
- The amountClaimed mapping tracks the total amount of NRN claimed by each user.
- Users can only claim rewards for rounds that have concluded and for which they have not already claimed.

**IV . Battle Record Update**
- The updateBattleRecord function is called by the game server to update the battle record for a fighter after a battle.
- The function updates the fighter's battle record, spends voltage if the fighter initiated the battle, and calculates points earned or lost based on the battle outcome.
- Points can be added to the fighter's and owner's accumulated points, or NRN tokens can be put at risk or reclaimed from the StakeAtRisk contract depending on the result.

**V . Admin Functions**
- The contract owner can transfer ownership, adjust admin access, set game server and contract addresses, and instantiate contract instances.
- Admins can set the NRN distribution for each round, adjust the basis points lost per loss, and advance to a new round.

**VI . Helper Functions**
- The contract includes view functions like getBattleRecord, getCurrentStakingData, getNrnDistribution, and getUnclaimedNRN to retrieve information about battle records, staking data, NRN distribution, and unclaimed rewards.

**VII . Events**
The contract emits events (Staked, Unstaked, Claimed, PointsChanged) to log significant actions, which can be used for tracking and verifying contract interactions.

**VIII . Dependencies**
The contract relies on external contracts (FighterFarm, VoltageManager, MergingPool, Neuron, StakeAtRisk) for various functionalities like token transfers, voltage management, and merging pool interactions.

### 8 .  StakeAtRisk.sol

The StakeAtRisk contract is designed to manage the stakes (in the form of NRN tokens) that are at risk of being lost during a round of competition in a game or a decentralized application. The contract interacts with a Neuron contract, which seems to be an ERC20-like token contract, and a RankedBattle contract, which likely manages the logic for the competitive rounds.


**Mechanism Review**



**I . Round Management**
 - The contract keeps track of the current round of competition using the roundId state variable. A new round is set by calling the setNewRound function, which can only be executed by the RankedBattle contract. When a new round is set, the contract sweeps all NRNs from the previous round to the treasury.

**II . Stake Management**
The contract manages stakes at risk through two primary functions:

- `reclaimNRN`: Allows the RankedBattle contract to reclaim NRNs on behalf of a fighter who has won a match. It checks if the fighter has enough stake at risk and then transfers the reclaimed amount from the contract to the RankedBattle contract.
- `updateAtRiskRecords`: Used by the RankedBattle contract to increase the stake at risk for a fighter who has lost a match and gone into a deficit. It updates the mappings to reflect the new total stake at risk and the individual fighter's stake.
- `Sweeping Lost Stakes`: The _sweepLostStake private function is called when setting a new round. It transfers all the lost stakes from the previous round to the treasury address. This function assumes that the Neuron contract's transfer function will always succeed.
- `Tracking Lost Stakes`: The contract maintains a mapping (amountLost) to track the total amount of NRNs that have been lost by each address.
- `Querying Stakes`: The getStakeAtRisk function allows anyone to query the amount of NRN tokens at risk for a specific fighter in the current round.

**III . Event Emission**
The contract emits two events to signal important state changes:

- `ReclaimedStake`: Emitted when NRNs are successfully reclaimed by a fighter.
- `IncreasedStakeAtRisk`: Emitted when the stake at risk for a fighter is increased.

**IV . Access Control
- The contract uses require statements to restrict the execution of key functions (setNewRound, reclaimNRN, and updateAtRiskRecords) to the RankedBattle contract only. This ensures that only the authorized contract can manipulate the stakes.

### 9 . VoltageManager.sol	


The VoltageManager contract is designed to manage a voltage system for a game called AI Arena. It includes functionality to manage voltage levels for players, adjust admin access, and transfer ownership of the contract. The contract interacts with a separate GameItems contract to burn game items (voltage batteries) in exchange for replenishing a player's voltage.



**Mechanism Review**

**I . Ownership Transfer**
- The transferOwnership function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address. This is a critical function that should be protected and possibly require multi-signature verification to prevent unauthorized transfers.

**II . Admin Access**
- The adjustAdminAccess function enables the owner to grant or revoke admin privileges. Admins can adjust the list of allowed voltage spenders. This function is central to the access control mechanism of the contract.

**III . Voltage Spender Authorization**
- The adjustAllowedVoltageSpenders function allows admins to authorize or deauthorize addresses to spend voltage on behalf of others. This is a key function for delegating voltage spending rights within the game.

**IV . Voltage Battery Usage**
- The useVoltageBattery function allows any player to replenish their voltage to full (100) by burning a voltage battery (assumed to be the item with ID 0 in the GameItems contract). This function checks that the player has less than full voltage and at least one voltage battery before proceeding.

**V . Voltage Spending**
- The `spendVoltage` function allows a player to spend their voltage or an authorized spender to spend voltage on behalf of the player. It checks if the voltage replenishment time has passed and, if so, replenishes the voltage before spending. This function does not check for underflow, which could be a potential issue if voltageSpent is greater than the player's current voltage.

**VI . Voltage Replenishment**
- The `_replenishVoltage` function is a private function that sets a player's voltage to full and updates their voltage replenishment time to one day in the future. This function is called internally when voltage is spent after the replenishment time.








## Economic Model Analysis

## Risk Analysis
### 1. Smart Contract Risks

**Ownership Control**
- Smart contracts with owner privileges pose a risk if ownership is not securely managed, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or control.

**Access Control**
-  Contracts relying on role-based access control (RBAC) must ensure proper assignment and revocation of roles to prevent unauthorized actions.

**External Contract Dependencies**
-  Contracts interacting with external contracts are vulnerable to risks associated with those dependencies, such as contract upgradeability issues or changes in external contract behavior.

**Vulnerabilities**
-  Contracts should undergo thorough security audits to mitigate risks associated with vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, and authorization flaws.

### 2. Economic Risks
**Tokenomics**
-  The economic model's sustainability depends on factors such as token distribution, inflationary/deflationary pressures, and mechanisms for value accrual.

**Staking Rewards**
-  The effectiveness of the staking and rewards mechanism relies on factors such as participation levels, battle outcomes, and overall user engagement.

**Game Balance**
-  The distribution and attributes of fighters and game items must be carefully balanced to ensure a fair and engaging gameplay experience, minimizing potential pay-to-win dynamics.

### 3. Game Dynamics Risks
**Player Engagement**
-  The success of the game ecosystem hinges on maintaining player interest and engagement through compelling gameplay, diverse content, and meaningful rewards.

**Market Dynamics**
- The in-game economy's stability depends on factors such as supply and demand dynamics for NFTs, game items, and tokens, as well as external market influences.

**Regulatory Risks** 
- Regulatory changes or uncertainties surrounding blockchain gaming, NFTs, or cryptocurrency markets could impact the game's operation and user experience.





## Codebase Quality Analysis

**Positive Aspects**
- The codebase exhibits clear separation of concerns and follows a modular design, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- Contracts adhere to relevant Ethereum standards (ERC721, ERC1155), ensuring compatibility and interoperability with other contracts and platforms.
- External contracts and libraries such as OpenZeppelin are utilized effectively, contributing to reliability and security.
- Contracts employ constructors to initialize state variables, ensuring correct contract setup upon deployment.
- Events are utilized for key actions, enhancing transparency and facilitating off-chain tracking.
-  Require statements are employed for access control and input validation, preventing unauthorized actions and ensuring contract integrity.
- Contracts follow Solidity style guide conventions, promoting consistency and readability.

**Areas of Improvement**
- While basic access control mechanisms exist, implementing more granular permissions or role-based access control would enhance security.
- Ensure comprehensive input validation across all functions, including constructor parameters, to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
- Implement measures to handle errors such as out-of-bounds array access and prevent overflow vulnerabilities.
- Incorporate inline comments to explain the logic and improve understanding, particularly for developers new to the codebase.
- Implement a withdrawal pattern for handling funds to mitigate potential security risks.
- Consider implementing an upgradeability pattern to facilitate future improvements or vulnerability fixes without contract redeployment.
- Ensure consistent application of access control modifiers like onlyOwner to prevent unauthorized access and streamline code.
- Implementing a role-based access control system would provide more granular and secure management of permissions.
- Incorporate a circuit breaker or pause functionality to mitigate risks in emergencies or critical bug scenarios.
- Enhance code clarity by providing informative error messages to aid in debugging and improve user experience.




## Centralization Risks 

-  owner role that can transfer ownership and adjust admin access. This centralizes power in the hands of the owner.

- Admins have the power to update the number of winners per period and select winners, which could be abused if not properly decentralized.

- The _delegatedAddress can set token URIs, which centralizes the metadata management.


- Admins have the power to create new game items, set token URIs,  allow addresses to burn tokens, set ranked NRN distribution, adjust basis points lost per loss, and advance the game to a new round.

- The isAdmin mapping allows for centralized control over who can set up airdrops, which could lead to potential misuse or favoritism.


- The game server address (_gameServerAddress) is authorized to update battle records, which is a centralized point of control.

- The treasury address is a centralized point where all lost stakes are swept. If the treasury's security is compromised, the funds could be at risk.



## Systematic Risks
- The use of a single treasury address for receiving funds from item purchases could be a risk if the treasury's security is compromised.

- The pickWinner function resets points without distributing rewards, which could lead to loss of points if not handled correctly.

- Neuron contract has a fixed maximum supply, which mitigates inflation risk. However, if the mint function is misused by an authorized minter, it could lead to an unexpected increase in token supply up to the maximum limit.

- The burnFrom function allows for tokens to be burned from an account with sufficient allowance, which could be used maliciously if an account's approval is obtained under false pretenses.

- The use of a game server to update battle records introduces a single point of failure. If the server is compromised, battle records could be manipulated.

- Contracts does not implement any emergency stop functionality (circuit breaker), which could be useful in case a critical issue is discovered.





## Architectural Recommendations

- Consider implementing a more decentralized governance model to reduce centralization risks.
- Introduce a role-based access control system to replace the binary admin flag for more nuanced permissions.
- Implement a more robust access control system, such as OpenZeppelin's Ownable or AccessControl contracts, to manage permissions more effectively.
- Add input validation checks to ensure that parameters passed to functions are within expected ranges or meet certain criteria.
- Emit events for critical state changes to enable off-chain monitoring and indexing of contract activity.
- Improve error handling and consider using custom error messages for better debugging and user experience.
- Implement a withdrawal pattern for funds to prevent accidental locking of funds within the contract.
- Consider implementing a circuit breaker or pause functionality to mitigate potential damage from unforeseen vulnerabilities.
- add checks to ensure that the inputs (e.g., fighter attributes) are within acceptable ranges or meet certain criteria.
- If the game is expected to evolve, consider implementing upgrade patterns for the library to allow for future improvements without disrupting the existing ecosystem.
- The getFighterPoints function needs to be fixed to properly initialize the array based on maxId. Additionally, consider gas optimization techniques where possible.
- Add checks to ensure that the mint function cannot be called when the total supply is equal to the maximum supply.
- Implement a multi-signature mechanism for critical owner-only functions to reduce the risk of a single point of failure.
- Consider adding a time lock or other mechanisms to owner-only functions to prevent sudden, unexpected changes.
- Review and potentially refactor the isAdmin mapping to integrate with OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for a more standardized approach to admin permissions.
- Introduce input validation checks where missing to ensure that function parameters meet expected criteria.
- Consider decentralizing the update of battle records by implementing a consensus mechanism or using a decentralized oracle to reduce reliance on a single game server.
- Consider adding a function to update the treasury address with proper access control to allow for changes in the treasury management.
- Implement additional checks or safety mechanisms to handle potential transfer failures when interacting with the Neuron contract.
- Implement additional checks or use an external time oracle to protect against block timestamp manipulation.
