A. Inconsistent State Update in pickWinner Function
[#L118-L132](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/cd1a0e6d1b40168657d1aaee8223dc050e15f8cc/src/MergingPool.sol#L118-L132)
- The `pickWinner` function is designed to select winners for the current round based on the provided list of token IDs (winners array). However, it lacks proper validation to ensure that the winners array is not empty. As a result, if the function is called with an empty array of `winners`, it proceeds to update the `isSelectionComplete` flag to `true` for the current round, indicating that `winners` have been selected. This behavior occurs regardless of whether any `winners` have actually been chosen, leading to an inconsistent state in the contract.
## Impact:
The impact of this vulnerability is that the contract state becomes inconsistent, as it indicates that winners have been selected for the current round even though no winners have actually been chosen. This inconsistency could confuse users and disrupt the normal operation of the merging pool.
## Mitigation:
```solidity
function pickWinner(uint256[] calldata winners) external {
    require(isAdmin[msg.sender]);
    require(winners.length == winnersPerPeriod, "Incorrect number of winners");
    require(!isSelectionComplete[roundId], "Winners are already selected");
    require(winners.length > 0, "Winners array cannot be empty"); // Validation to ensure winners array is not empty

    isSelectionComplete[roundId] = true;
    roundId += 1;
}

```
