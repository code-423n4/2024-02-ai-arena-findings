## Quality Assurance Report
## Summary:
The codebase includes multiple require statements scattered across various parts of the codebase. These statements could be consolidated into a single modifier or internal function to improve readability, maintainability, and reduce redundancy.

## Findings:
Scattered require Statements: The contract contains require statements such as require(isAdmin[msg.sender]) and require(msg.sender == _ownerAddress) dispersed throughout different functions.
such functions can be found:

### Opportunity for Consolidation: These require statements serve similar purposes across the codebase. By consolidating them into a single modifier or internal function, code redundancy can be reduced, and readability can be improved.

### Enhanced Maintainability: Consolidating require statements into a single location enhances code maintainability by centralizing access control logic. It makes it easier to update access control requirements in the future without needing to modify multiple functions.

## Recommendations:
Consolidate Access Control Logic: Create a single modifier or internal function to encapsulate access control logic. This function can be reused across different parts of the contract where access control is required.

### Utilize Modifiers: Modifiers can streamline access control logic and improve code readability. Consider creating modifiers like onlyAdmin or onlyOwner to enforce access control requirements consistently.

### Review Existing Functionality: Review existing functions to identify areas where access control logic can be standardized and consolidated. Ensure that access control requirements are consistently enforced throughout the contract.

## Conclusion:
Consolidating require statements into a single modifier or internal function is recommended to improve code maintainability and readability. By centralizing access control logic, the contract can be easier to maintain and update in the future. Consider implementing these recommendations to enhance the overall quality of the codebase.
