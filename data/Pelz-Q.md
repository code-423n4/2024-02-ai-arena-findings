## Quality Assurance Report
## Summary:
The codebase includes multiple require statements scattered across various parts of the codebase. These statements could be consolidated into a single modifier or internal function to improve readability, maintainability, and reduce redundancy.

## Findings:
Scattered require Statements: The contract contains require statements such as `require(isAdmin[msg.sender])` and `require(msg.sender == _ownerAddress)` dispersed throughout different functions.
such functions can be found:

### Opportunity for Consolidation: 
These require statements serve similar purposes across the codebase. By consolidating them into a single modifier or internal function, code redundancy can be reduced, and readability can be improved.

### Enhanced Maintainability: 
Consolidating require statements into a single location enhances code maintainability by centralizing access control logic. It makes it easier to update access control requirements in the future without needing to modify multiple functions.

## Recommendations:
### Consolidate Access Control Logic:
 Create a single modifier or internal function to encapsulate access control logic. This function can be reused across different parts of the contract where access control is required.

### Utilize Modifiers:
 Modifiers can streamline access control logic and improve code readability. Consider creating modifiers like onlyAdmin or onlyOwner to enforce access control requirements consistently.

### Review Existing Functionality: Review existing functions to identify areas where access control logic can be standardized and consolidated. Ensure that access control requirements are consistently enforced throughout the contract.

## Conclusion:
Consolidating require statements into a single modifier or internal function is recommended to improve code maintainability and readability. By centralizing access control logic, the contract can be easier to maintain and update in the future. Consider implementing these recommendations to enhance the overall quality of the codebase.

## Summary 2:
During the code review process, it was discovered that certain functions within the codebase are marked as public but are never utilized within the contract where they are defined. Given that these functions are not accessed internally within the contract, marking them as external could improve clarity and optimize gas usage.

## Findings:
### Unutilized Public Functions: 
Several functions within the codebase are declared as public but are not accessed or utilized within the contract where they are defined.

### Potential Optimization:
 Marking these unused functions as external could optimize gas usage and improve contract efficiency. External functions incur lower gas costs compared to public functions when called externally.

## Recommendations:
### Review Unused Functions: Conduct a thorough review of all functions declared as public within the codebase to identify those that are not accessed or utilized within the contract.

### Update Function Visibility: For functions that are not utilized internally, consider updating their visibility to external if they are only meant to be accessed externally. This change can optimize gas usage and improve contract efficiency.

## Conclusion:
Updating the visibility of unused functions to external can improve the efficiency and gas optimization of the contract. By conducting a comprehensive review and making the necessary updates, the codebase can be streamlined to enhance readability and maintainability. Additionally, documenting the purpose and visibility of functions in the code comments can aid in understanding and future development efforts.
