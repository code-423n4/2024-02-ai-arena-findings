**Setup**

Clone with recurse:

```bash
git clone --recurse https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena.git
```

Install libraries using forge and compile contracts.

```bash
forge install

forge build
```

After installing and building contracts I ran this command to execute all the test scripts:

```bash
forge test
```

To execute an indivial test I did it using

```bash
forge test --match-path test/AiArenaHelper.t.sol -vvvv
```

To print the gas report of contracts I simply ran:

```bash
forge test --gas-report
```

See code coverage by running this command:

```bash
forge coverage --ir-minimum
```


### What did the project do differently? ;
-   1) It can be said that the developers of the project did a quality job, there is a test structure consisting of tests with quality content. In particular, tests have been written successfully.

-   2) Overall line coverage percentage provided by your tests : 90%

### What could they have done better?

-  1) If we look at the test scope and content of the project with a systematic checklist, we can see which parts are good and which areas have room for improvement As a result of my analysis, those marked in green are the ones that the project has fully achieved. The remaining areas are the development areas of the project in terms of testing ;


[![test-cases.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/1zgD5wCt/test-cases.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/v1s40gdF)

-  2): It is recommended to increase the test coverage to 100% so make sure that each and every line is battle tested

## f) Security Approach of the Project

### Successful current security understanding of the project;

1- The project hasn't underwent any audit(nothing stated in the docs), this innovative assessments on Code4rena is the first one, where multiple auditors are scrutinizing the code.

### What the project should add in the understanding of Security;

1- By distributing the project to testnets, ensuring that the audits are carried out in onchain audit. (This will increase coverage)

2- Add On-Chain Monitoring System; If On-Chain Monitoring systems such as Forta are added to the project, its security will increase.

For example ; This bot tracks any DEFI transactions in which wrapping, unwrapping, swapping, depositing, or withdrawals occur over a threshold amount. If transactions occur with unusually high token amounts, the bot sends out an alert. https://app.forta.network/bot/0x7f9afc392329ed5a473bcf304565adf9c2588ba4bc060f7d215519005b8303e3

3- After the Code4rena audit is completed and the project is live, I recommend the audit process to continue, projects like immunefi do this. 
https://immunefi.com/

4- Emergency Action Plan
In a high-level security approach, there should be a crisis handbook like the one below and the strategic members of the project should be trained on this subject and drills should be carried out. Naturally, this information and road plan will not be available to the public.
https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1DaAiuGFkMEMMiIuvqhePL5aDFGHJ9Ya6D04rdaldqC0/mobilebasic#h.27dmpkyp2k1z

5- I also recommend that you have an "Economic Audit" for projects based on such complex mathematics and economic models. An example Economic Audit is provided in the link below;
Economic Audit with [Three Sigma](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/panoptic-three-sigma-partnership)

6 - As the project team, you can consider applying the multi-stage audit model.

[![sla.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nhR0kN3w/sla.png)](https://postimg.cc/Sn96Q1FW)

Read more about the MPA model;
https://mpa.solodit.xyz/

7 - I recommend having a masterplan applied to project team members (This information is not included in the documents).
All authorizations, including NPM passwords and authorizations, should be reserved only for current employees. I also recommend that a definitive security constitution project be found for employees to protect these passwords with rules such as 2FA. The LEDGER hack, which has made a big impact recently, is the best example in this regard;

## g) In-depth architecture assessment of business logic

The AI Arena's architecture is designed around a core principle of integrating blockchain technology with competitive AI gaming. This results in a multi-faceted ecosystem that leverages NFTs, a proprietary utility token (NRN), and smart contracts to create a dynamic and engaging user experience. The protocol's business logic is embedded within its smart contracts, ensuring transparency, security, and fairness for all participants. Here's an in-depth assessment of its architecture and business logic:

1. **NFT Fighters and Ownership**: Central to AI Arena are NFT Fighters, each uniquely represented on the blockchain, providing verifiable ownership and scarcity. These NFTs are not just collectibles but are integral to the gameplay, acting as the avatars through which players interact with the AI Arena ecosystem. The Fighters' attributes and training progress are stored immutably, ensuring that each NFT evolves in a way that is transparent and tamper-proof.

2. **Neuron (NRN) Token Economy**: The NRN token is the lifeblood of the AI Arena, facilitating transactions, staking, and governance within the ecosystem. It's used for purchasing NFT Fighters, entering competitions, staking on outcomes, and claiming rewards. This creates a circular economy where tokens are recycled through various aspects of the game, driving engagement and incentivizing participation.

3. **Gaming Competitions and Leaderboard**: The protocol hosts AI-driven competitions where NFT Fighters battle based on their training and attributes. Success in these competitions is rewarded with NRN tokens and higher leaderboard rankings, fostering a competitive environment. The leaderboard is a smart contract that dynamically updates based on competition outcomes, ensuring real-time tracking of players' standings.

4. **Staking and Rewards Mechanism**: Players can stake NRN tokens on their Fighters or competition outcomes, integrating a DeFi element into the gaming experience. The staking mechanism is designed to reward players for active participation and successful predictions, distributing rewards from a pool accumulated through entry fees and other in-game activities. This mechanism is carefully balanced to ensure sustainability and to incentivize long-term engagement.

5. **Merging Pool and Fighter Evolution**: The merging pool offers a unique feature where players can stake their NFT Fighters to gain access to upgrades or new Fighters, enhancing their capabilities. This introduces an element of strategy and resource management, as players must decide the best way to allocate their assets for optimal growth and performance.


### Architectural Interactions

The interaction between the NFT and ERC20 contracts forms the backbone of the project's business logic. Assets are tokenized into NFTs, each with its revenue-generation capabilities. The revenue is then pooled and distributed through the ERC20 tokens, linking the asset management component directly with investor returns. This architecture facilitates a direct correlation between the performance of individual assets and the dividends received by investors, embedding transparency and fairness into the business model.

The allowlist mechanism further interacts with the ERC20 token distribution process, ensuring that only eligible participants receive revenue. This interaction underscores the project's commitment to regulatory compliance and security, integrating these considerations seamlessly into the business logic.



## h) Codebase Quality

Overall, I consider the quality of the AI Arena protocol codebase to be Good. The code appears to be mature and well-developed. We have noticed the implementation of various standards adhere to appropriately. Details are explained below:


| Codebase Quality Categories                | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture & Design**                  | The protocol features a modular design, segregating functionality into distinct contracts (e.g., FighterFarm, RankedBattle, MergingPool) for clarity and ease of maintenance. The use of libraries like FixedPointMathLib for mathematical operations also indicates thoughtful design choices aimed at optimizing contract performance and gas efficiency. |
| **Security Practices**                     | The contracts demonstrate awareness of common security pitfalls in Solidity development. Functions are guarded with appropriate access control modifiers (e.g., `onlyOwner`, `isAdmin` checks), and state-changing functions are protected against reentrancy attacks. However, a comprehensive external security audit would be necessary to validate the absence of deeper vulnerabilities.                          |
| **Upgradeability & Flexibility**           | The project does not explicitly implement upgradeability patterns (e.g., proxy contracts), which might impact long-term maintainability. Considering an upgrade path or versioning strategy could enhance the project's flexibility in addressing future requirements..                                                                                                                             |
| **Efficiency & Gas Optimization**          | The code demonstrates an awareness of gas optimization in some areas, such as using mappings for efficient data storage. However, the iterative nature of functions could be optimized for gas efficiency and scalability.                                                                               |
| **Community Governance & Participation**   | The protocol incorporates mechanisms for community governance, enabling token holders to influence decisions. This fosters a decentralized and participatory ecosystem, aligning with the broader ethos of blockchain development.                                                                                                             |
| **Error Handling & Input Validation**      | Functions check for conditions and validate inputs to prevent invalid operations, though the depth of validation (e.g., for edge cases in gameplay or token transactions) would benefit from closer examination.                                                                                                                               |
